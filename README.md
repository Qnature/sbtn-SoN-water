## State of Nature layers for Water Availability and Water Pollution to support SBTN Step 1: Assess and Step 2: Interpret & Prioritize

This repo contains the code to generate the two ready-to-use unified layers of State of Nature (SoN) for water -- one for water availability and one for water pollution -- in line with the in line with the Technical Guidance for Steps 1: Assess and Step 2: Interpret & Prioritize. The output is a single file (shapefile) containing the maximum value both for Water Availability and for Water Pollution as well as the datasets' raw values (as reference). This data and documentation is publicly available for download from <https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.7797979> .

These unified layers will enable companies to implement a robust approach more easily and will lead to more aligned and comparable results between companies. A temporary App is available at <https://arcg.is/0z9mOD0> to help companies assessing the SoN for Water Availability and Water Pollution around their operations and supply chain locations. In the future these layers will become available both in the [WRI's Aqueduct](https://www.wri.org/aqueduct) and in the [WWF Risk Filter Suite](https://riskfilter.org/).
